                    <p>Robert Perry [R. P.] Christeson, known as the "Dean of Missouri Fiddle Music," has been variously described as "a gentleman's gentleman, very kind and smart," "an important preservationist of early fiddle music," and "quite a character." Because of his lifetime of work as a collector and promoter of traditional Missouri fiddle music and his two important books of transcribed traditional tunes, he has acquired an international reputation among musicologists and historians.</p><p>Click <a href="http://www.oldstagecoachstop.org/webgeezer/Gazette09/pages%2042-49%20R.%20P.%20Christeson.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to read more.</p>

                    <h1>Lyman Enloe</h1> 
                    <p>Lyman Enloe was unusual in his fondness for bluegrass as well as old-time music, and his famous 1973 LP, “Fiddle Tunes I Recall” is a model recording of a fine old-time fiddler backed by a skilled bluegrass ensemble, The Bluegrass Association. In addition, the album contains a number of quite local tunes handed down to Lyman from fiddlers he learned from. Enloe and Kenny Baker (Bill Monroe’s favorite fiddler) jammed at many bluegrass festivals, and it was Lyman who taught Baker “Oklahoma Redbird” which has become part of the bluegrass fiddle repertoire.</p><p>Click <a href="https://mofiddledance.org/profiles/lyman-enloe/" target="_blank">here</a> to read more.</p>

                    <p>Gene Goforth was born into a musical family in 1921 in Shannon County. Gene took to the fiddle with a great deal of determination and by the age of eight was playing for socials and dances. Gene got both repertoire and style from sources like Roy Wolliver, Arthur Smith, Benny Martin, Howdy Forester, and, of course, from WSM’s Grand Ole Opry. Gene worked as a heavy equipment operator in St. Louis for many years, while contributing to the entertainment and learning of young musicians and other displaced Ozarkers.</p><p>Click <a href="https://mofiddledance.org/profiles/gene-goforth/" target="_blank">here</a> to read more.</p>

                    <p>A fourth generation old-time musician, Vesta Johnson began playing fiddle in 1929, at the age of 7. She was taught by her father, mother, aunts and uncles, and other respected fiddlers from around Linn County, Missouri. She only plays by ear and never learned to read music. Vesta will tell you that she’s played at jams, contests, and festivals “everywhere,” and she still gives lessons to both adults and children.</p><p>Click <a href="https://mofiddledance.org/profiles/vesta-johnson/" target="_blank">here</a> to read more.</p>
