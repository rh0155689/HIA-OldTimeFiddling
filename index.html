                    <h1>Old-Time Fiddle Music: An Introduction</h1>            
                    <p>First documented in the late 1700s, the fiddle has had an active role in the development of Missouri music and the culture of the state. As time progressed, fiddle music became as unique to the individual as much as it did to the region it was from. Three major styles emerged - North Missouri, Little Dixie and Ozark style, and they showcased the exceptional abilities of its players. The heritage of the people is also important to express as it gives Missouri fiddle music a distinctive style that has lasted for hundreds of years. Many songs are passed down through generations, traditionally learned by ear as the way the stylistic elements are expressed cannot be learned by reading sheet music alone. Today, the art of old-time fiddle music remains, not as prevalent as it once was, but still alive and thriving.</p>

                    <h1>Honors in Action: What We Can Do to Preserve the Art of Old-Time Fiddle Music</h1>            
                    <p>Our journey began with an investigation into bluegrass music and quickly we were pulled into the rabbit hole known as old-time fiddle music. None of us could have imagined we would find something so culturally significant and yet so unknown. The further we dug into the past, the more we realized we had to do something to preserve this art for future generations. It is our goal to educate the general public and support the endeavors of current fiddle players and connoisseurs alike. We hope that you take this opportunity to explore the roots of old-time fiddle music and experience the extraordinary music our predecessors have to offer.</p>
